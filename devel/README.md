# Instructions for Running my Project
**NOTE: The project defaults to Orlando as the city it shows when you open it. I did it this way because getting user Geolocation requires explicit permission given by the user, and I wanted it to just open and work, not have a permission pop-up every time you open it. Just click the "Use My Current Location" button to make it center around where you are.**
To run this project, all you need is an active internet connection, and a web browser, such as Google Chrome, or Mozilla FireFox.
